# Train Control

Train control is the process by which the movement of rail rapid transit vehicles is regulated for the purposes of safety and efficiency. The process is carried out by a combination of elements - some men, some machines - located on the train, along the track, in stations, and at remote central facilities. These elements interact to form a command and control system with four major functions:

- **Train Protection**: prevention of collisions and derailments,
- **Train Operation**: control of train movement and stopping at stations,
- **Train Supervision**: direction of train movement in relation to schedule,
- **Communication**: interchange of information among the elements of the system.

The train control system is analogous to the sensory organs and central nervous system of the human body. It senses and processes information, makes decisions, and transmits commands. Also as in the human body, the execution of commands is not a function of the train control system but of other parts specialized for that purpose. For example, the train control system may sense train speed, determine that it should be increased, provide an appropriate command signal to the motors, and monitor to see that the desired result is achieved. The means by which a speed change is effected, however, are not part of the train control system. All the equipment for getting electric power to the wayside, bringing it into the train, converting it to mechanical energy, and providing tractive effort is external to the train control system. Similarly, the equipment to select a route for a particular train and transmit commands to align switches accordingly are within the train control system, but the parts of the trackwork that actually move (the switch points) are not elements of the train control system.

## TRAIN CONTROL SYSTEM FUNCTIONS

Presented below is a description of the specific functions performed by a train control system and of the way in which functional elements interact. These functional relationships are also illustrated by the diagram in figure 1. Since the purpose is only to provide the reader with a general background for understanding the nature of train control, the definitions presented here are brief and nontechnical.

### Train Protection

Train protection is a family of functions whose purpose is to assure the safety of train movement by preventing collisions and derailments. Train protection functions and requirements override all other control system functions either through equipment design or, in a completely manual mode, by rules and procedures. The functions that make up train protection are:

- **Train detection**: monitoring of the track to determine the presence and location of trains;
- **Train separation**: assuring that trains on the same track maintain a safe following distance to prevent collisions;
- **Route interlocking**: preventing trains on crossing, merging, or branching routes from making conflicting (unsafe) moves that would cause a collision or derailment;
- **Overspeed protection**: assuring that train speed remains at or below the commanded or posted civil speed limit to prevent collisions resulting from going too fast to stop within the available distance and to prevent derailments due to excessive speed on curves or through switches;
- **Train and track surveillance**: observing conditions on and in the vicinity of the track ahead of the train and monitoring safety-related conditions on board the train.

### Train Operation

Train operation consists of those functions necessary to move the train and to stop it at stations. You're right, my previous Markdown formatting of the text content was incomplete. Here is the content formatted with Markdown headings and code block:

# Train Protection

Train protection involves the detection of faults or failures in train operation, the transmission of the failure information to safety control equipment, and the automatic taking of appropriate safety actions—all on a time scale that precludes human intervention.

## Speed Control

Lateral train separation depends directly on speed control. With multiple tracks, trains can pass in opposite directions at very close headways if their speeds are identical and maintained within close tolerances.

## Train Stop Protection

Activating the brakes to bring the train to a stop before a certain point is reached.

## Train Separation Protection

Speed supervision assists in keeping proper spacing between trains and in preventing collisions.

# Train Operation

Train operation involves regulation of train movement to pick up and discharge passengers. Train movement, as controlled by train operation functions, is under the direction of train supervisory functions and always within the constraints of train protection functions. Train operation involves the following:

- Speed regulation-controlling train speed, within the constraints of overspeed protection, to make the run according to schedule

- Station stopping—bringing the train to a stop within some specified area in a station

- Door control--opening of doors in stations to permit passengers to enter or leave the train and closing of doors when the train is ready to start

- Train starting—initiating train departure from a station after the doors are closed (and provided the train protection system permits it)

# Train Supervision

Train supervision involves monitoring the movement of individual trains in relation to schedule and route assignments and overseeing the general disposition of vehicles and flow of traffic for the system as a whole.

The train supervision system may thus be thought of as making strategic decisions which the train operation system carries out tactically.

In addition, train supervision includes certain information processing and recording activities not directly concerned with train safety and movement but necessary to the general scheme of operations.

Train supervision functions are:

- Schedule design and implementation—preparing a plan of service in light of expected demand, available equipment, and environmental conditions and issuing a schedule to implement the plan

- Route assignment and control--selecting and assigning routes to be followed by trains (and rerouting as necessary)

- Train dispatching-controlling train departures from terminals or waypoints in accordance with the schedule

- Performance monitoring—following the progress of trains against the schedule by obtaining periodic updates of train identity, location, and destination

- Performance modification—adjusting movement commands and revising the schedule in response to train, traffic, and environmental conditions.

- Alarms and malfunction recording-alerting to malfunctions, breakdowns, or problems, and recording their time, location, and nature

- Recordkeeping —maintaining operational logs and records for business and payroll purposes, for scheduling maintenance, for ordering supplies and equipment, and for computing technical statistics.

# Communication

The communication system is the means by which the information needed to carry out all other train control functions is transmitted and exchanged. This information may take any of several forms-voice, visual, auditory, and digital or analog electrical signals.

Unlike other train control functions, which involve information processing and decision-making, communication is largely a facilitative process—serving to convey information without producing any unique functional outcomes of and by itself. For this reason, the categorization given below indicates not functions as such but major classes of information that must flow throughout the system in order for other train control functions to take place:

- **Train protection**: Information necessary to locate individual trains, assure their safe separation, prevent overspeed, and control movement at route interlockings.^16^
- **Command and status**: Information on the operational state of the system, command signals to control train and switch movement, and feedback to determine the response of system elements to command inputs.^16^
- **Emergency**: Information on the nature and location of emergency events and summons for help to elements within the transit system or to outside agencies (e.g., fire, police, medical, and rescue).
- **Passenger service**: Information relating to train service and system operation for assisting passengers using transit facilities.
- **Maintenance**: Information needed to plan or conduct preventive and corrective maintenance.
- **Business operations**: Operational information used to maintain a record of (and to plan for) workforce allocation, vehicle utilization, procurement of supplies and equipment, operating expenses, and system patronage.

^15^ Some transit engineers limit the definition of communication to verbal or visual communication (radio, telephone, TV, etc.). Machine-to-machine communications, since they tend to be specialized, are considered part of the function which they serve. This view seems restrictive and makes an artificial distinction between information exchange by human operators and other forms. The definition here is generic, embracing all types of information flow, no matter the means.

^16^ Typically, this part of the communication system is separate from the network used for other information types and is seen as an integral part of the train protection system.

### AUTOMATION

At one time or another, all of the train control functions listed above have been performed by human operators, and many still are, even in the most technologically advanced transit systems. Theoretically, any of these functions could also be performed by automatic devices, and more and more have, in fact, been assigned to machines over the years, Before examining the technology by which train control automation has been achieved, it is first necessary to consider what is meant by automation and to clarify the terminology used in this report.

_Figure 2_ is a generalized diagram of the process by which any train control function is accomplished. It involves receiving information about some operational state of the system and some desired state. This information must then be interpreted— for example, by comparing the two states and deriving a quantitative expression of the difference, Next, an appropriate control response to null the difference must be selected, and some specific command message to the controlled element must be formulated and transmitted. A final, and all-important, step is monitoring the results of the control action to ascertain that the desired system state or condition has been achieved. This last step, called feedback, provides an input signal to start the process all over again, thereby creating a loop that permits the control process to be continuous and adaptive.l7

If all of the steps in the general sequence shown in _Figure 2_ are performed by a human operator, the process is called manual, even though manual action in the strict sense may not be involved. Thus, manual denotes a process that may include visual, auditory, and other forms of sensory perception as well as purely cognitive activities such as interpretation, weighing alternatives, and decisionmaking. The command output might be accomplished by some manual activity such as pressing a button or moving a control lever, or it might take the form of a voice command or simply a nod of the head. The essential feature of a manual process, as the term is used here, is that all the basic control steps to accomplish a function are human activities. the general sequence shown in _Figure 2_ are performed by a human operator, the process is called manual, even though manual action in the strict sense may not be involved. Thus, manual denotes a process that may include visual, auditory, and other forms of sensory perception as well as purely cognitive activities such as interpretation, weighing alternatives, and decision-making. The command output might be accomplished by some manual activity such as pressing a button or moving a control lever, or it might take the form of a voice command or simply a nod of the head. The essential feature of a manual process, as the term is used here, is that all the basic control steps to accomplish a function are human activities.

It is also possible for all of the steps in the control loop to be accomplished by some mechanical or electrical device. If so, the process is called automated. The device need not necessarily be complicated, nor is a computer required in order for the apparatus to process information and make a “decision.” A simple junction box with a two-state logic circuit (ON or OFF) would satisfy the definition of an automated control device, provided no human actions were required to receive and interpret input signals, select and order a response, and monitor the result.

Between the extremes of purely manual control and fully automatic control, there are numerous combinations of mixed man-machine control loops. These are called semi-automated or partially automated— the terms are used synonymously to denote a process (or a system) in which there are both manual and automatic elements. Thus, automation is not to be taken in an absolute, all-or-nothing sense. The machine can be introduced by degrees into a system to perform specific functions or parts of functions. When comparing parts of a train control system or when comparing one system with another, it is therefore possible to speak of automation in comparative terms and to say that one is more or less automated than another, depending on how many specific functions are performed by machines.

For brevity, acronyms are used to describe certain areas where automation is applied in train control. ATC (automatic train control) refers generally to the use of machines to accomplish train control functions. It does not necessarily suggest a completely automated system. It can be applied to a system where certain functions or groups of functions are performed automatically while others are performed manually. ATP (automatic train protection), ATO (automatic train operation), and ATS (automatic train supervision) are used to designate major groups of functions that may be automated. For example, if a system is said to have ATP, it means that train protection is accomplished (either completely or mostly) by automatic devices without direct human involvement. If a system is described as having ATC consisting of ATP and some ATS, this indicates that train protection is assured by automatic devices and that train supervision is a mixture of manual and automatic elements. By implication, train operation in such a system would be manual.

While automation involves the substitution of machine for human control, this does not mean that the human operator is removed from the system altogether. An automated system is not always an unmanned system, even though all functions are routinely performed by machines. For instance, train protection and train operation may be completely automatic in a given transit system, but there could still be an operator or attendant on board the train to oversee equipment operation and, most importantly, to intervene in the event of failure or malfunction. This emergency and backup role is, in fact, a major type of human involvement in even the most automated train control systems. In all rail rapid transit train control systems now in ...operation or under development, automation is utilized only for normal modes of operation, with manual backup as the alternative for unusual conditions, breakdowns, and emergencies.

In passing, it should also be noted that automation is not synonymous with remote control, even though the two may at times go hand in hand. In train supervision, for example, many functions are accomplished manually by controllers who are physically far removed from the train and wayside. In central control facilities, the operators may never actually see the vehicles or track and yet perform all or most of the functions necessary to set up routes, dispatch trains, and monitor traffic. Conversely, automated functions are often performed locally, i.e., by devices on board the train or at a station or switch. In general, the location of the controlling element in relation to the controlled element is independent of how the functions are accomplished. However, it is also true that automation does facilitate the process of remote control, and systems with a high level of ATC tend also to employ more centralized forms of train control, especially for supervisory functions.

### AUTOMATIC TRAIN CONTROL TECHNOLOGY

The automatic equipment that accomplishes train control functions is often of complex design, but the basic technology is quite simple. The purpose of this section is to provide an acquaintance with the fundamental elements of an ATC system—track circuits, signaling apparatus, train operating devices, interlocking controls, and supervisory equipment. The details of this technology and the design features of ATC equipment now in use in rail rapid transit systems are omitted here but are provided in appendices B and C.

#### Track Circuits

For safety and efficient operation of a transit system, it is imperative to know the locations of trains at all times. The sensing device providing this information is the track circuit, which was invented over 100 years ago and has remained essentially unchanged in principle even though extensively refined and modified in its engineering details.

The track circuit is an electrical circuit consisting of a power source, the running rails, and a signal receiver (relay). The track is divided into electrically isolated segments (called blocks) by insulated joints placed at intervals in the running rails. This forms a circuit with a power source connected to the rails at one end of the block and a relay at the other. The relay, in turn, forms part of a second electrical circuit which has its own independent power supply (commonly a battery) and includes a signaling device such as wayside colored lights.

When no train occupies the block, the relay is energized by the track circuit battery, causing the relay to “pick up.” However, when a train enters the block, the wheels and axles conduct electricity between the running rails, short-circuiting the track circuit and reducing the current to the relay. The relay acts as a switch in the secondary signal circuit, creating one electrical path when it picks up and another when it drops. Thus, the basic principle of the track circuit is the shunting phenomenon produced by the train wheels passing along the electrically energized running rails.

The track circuit is designed according to the fail-safe principle. A clear (unoccupied block) indication can only be given if the track circuit is in proper working order. Any malfunctions, such as broken rails or a failure of the power source, would produce an occupied signal, ensuring safety.

#### Wayside Signals

One of the earliest and still widely used signal devices for controlling train movement is the automatic wayside block signal. It consists of a color-light signal, similar to city traffic signals, located beside the track at the entrance to each block. This signal is controlled by the track circuit relay. The signal displays red, yellow, or green lights (aspects) to indicate track circuit occupancy ahead.

To allow trains to operate efficiently, wayside signals give the operator advanced indication of speed and stopping commands. For instance, a three-block, three-aspect wayside signal system would convey three different movement commands—green (proceed), yellow (proceed prepared to stop at the next signal), and red (stop). If Train A is stopped in Block 4 and Train B is approaching from behind, Train B will receive signals to notify it of the position of Train A and when it should prepare to stop or proceed.

The wayside signaling system is designed to be fail-safe. It uses multiple lamps for each signal aspect and sometimes redundant power sources. If all else fails, standard operating rules dictate that a dark (unlighted) signal is to be observed by the train operator as a stop command, ensuring the safety of the system.

### Trip Stops

In the wayside signal system described above,
safe train movement depends solely on the compliance
of the operator with signal indications. To
guard against error, inattention, or incapacitation of
the train operator, wayside signals can be supplemented
with an automatic stop-enforcing mechanism,
called a trip stop.
The trip stop is a device located beside the track
at each wayside signal. The type commonly used in
the United States consists of a mechanical arm that
is raised or lowered in response to the track occupancy
detected by the track circuit. When the arm is
in the raised position, it engages a triggering device
on the train and actuates (trips) the emergency
brake.20 A train entering a block in violation of the
wayside signal indication would thus be brought to
a complete stop before colliding with the train in
the next block regardless of what action the train
operator took, or
In addition to
sions, trip stops
failed to take.
protecting against rear-end collican
also be used in conjunction
with the track circuits and other signal appliances to
provide automatic protection against overspeed. For
this application, a timing device is added to the circuit
controlling the trip stop. When a train enters a
block, the trip stop at the entrance to the next block
is in the raised position but will be lowered after a
time interval corresponding to the minimum time
(the maximum speed) permitted for a train to traverse
the block. This arrangement is commonly
used on curves, downgrades, and other such sections
of track where excessive speed could cause a
derailment. A variation of this scheme is commonly
used at stations to allow a following train to close in
on a leading train, provided the follower moves at
appropriately diminishing speed as it approaches its
leader.
Like track circuits and signals, the trip stop is
designed to operate in a fail-safe manner. The trip is
raised to the stopping position by gravity or a heavy
spring and lowered by a pneumatic or electric
mechanism. Thus, failure of the trip stop actuating
mechanism or its source of energy will result in the
trip stop being raised to the stop position.

### Cab Signals

Automatic block signal systems with wayside
signals and trip stops, while offering effective train
protection, have certain operational disadvantages.
Sometimes the signals are obscured by fog, rain, or
snow. In such cases, operating rules require that the
operator consider the signal as displaying its most
restrictive aspect and operate the train accordingly.
If the signal is actually displaying a more permissive
indication, time is lost unnecessarily. A second
disadvantage is that wayside signals convey
commands only at the entrance to a block. The train
operator must reduce speed to the maximum permitted
by the signal and maintain that speed until
reaching the next signal. If conditions change immediately
after the train enters the block and it
becomes safe to proceed at a greater speed, the train
operator has no way of knowing this since the signal
is behind him. Again, time is lost. With wayside
block signals there is also the possibility that the
operator will fail to observe the signal correctly,
read the wrong signal in multiple-track territory, or
forget the indication of the last signal passed. If
there are trip stops, these kinds of human failure do
not result in an unsafe condition, but the efficiency
of train operation can be adversely affected.
One way to overcome these disadvantages is to
provide signal displays within the cab of the train,
This is called cab signaling, A display unit, mounted
in the cab within the train operator’s forward field
of view, shows indicator lights similar to those of
wayside signals, e.g., red, yellow, and green aspects.
Cab signals can thus convey the same movement
commands as wayside signals, but they do so continuously
in response to the instantaneous condition
of the track ahead. They can also convey precise
speed commands instead of just stop-and-go information,
thus providing more flexible operation
and paving the way to ATO. The cab signal unit has
an audible warning that sounds whenever the signal
aspect becomes more restrictive and continues
to sound until the operator silences it by an
acknowledging device. Figure 5 is an illustration of
a typical cab signal.
Transferring the display of information from the
wayside to the cab involves an alternate type of
track circuit technology. To operate cab signals, the
current passing through the track circuit (usually
a.c. is not steady, as for conventional wayside signals,
but is pulsed (turned on and off) at several
different repetition rates in response to track occupancy.
Each pulse rate is a code to indicate allowable
train speed. This pulsed d.c. energy is passed
through the rails, picked up inductively by a
receiver (antenna) on the train, and decoded to
retrieve speed command information, This information
is used to actuate the appropriate cab signal
display. Because the train is continuously receiving
pulses of energy, a change in the pulse rate of the
coded track circuits indicating a change of conditions
ahead of the train is instantaneously received
by carborne equipment and displayed by cab signals
regardless of where the train happens to be within a
block.

Figure 6 illustrates how cab signals control a
train in a three-block, three-aspect signaling
system. In this example, the code rates transmitted
through the rails (expressed as pulses per minute)
correspond to the following signal aspects:
180 Green (Proceed)
75 Yellow (Proceed at medium speed
prepared to stop)
O Red (stop)

The situation depicted here is the same as in the illustration
of wayside signals (figure 4). Train B is
approaching Train A, which is completely stopped,
Note that the moment Train A starts to move and
clears the block, Train B receives a green signal immediately—
not at the entrance to the next block, as
it would with wayside signals. Note also that a O
code appears in the part of the block immediately
behind Train B as it moves along the track closer to Train A before being required to stop.

### Speed Control

With the addition of speed sensing and brake
control mechanisms, cab signals can also be used to
provide automatic overspeed protection. Figure 7 is
a schematic diagram of such a system. It is the same
as the schematic shown in figure 5, except for the
addition of speed and code rate comparison equipment
and the direct connections to the propulsion
and braking systems.
This arrangement allows the train operator to
control speed so long as it does not exceed the commanded
speed shown on the cab signal unit. If the
commanded speed is exceeded or if the block speed
changes to a lower value because of another train
ahead, the operator receives an audible warning.
The operator has a fixed time (typically 2 to 3 seconds)
to initiate the required braking manually. If
this is done, the brakes can be released when the
commanded lower speed is reached. If not, the
brakes are applied automatically and irrevocably by
the ATC system, and the train is brought to a full
stop before the operator can resume control. This is
analogous to the overspeed control provided by
wayside signals with trip stops, except that braking
can be initiated anywhere within a block not just at
the entrance. Another difference is that trip stops
act to stop the train after an overspeed condition has
occurred over a measured course, usually several
hundred feet in length. Cab signals do the same, but
instantaneously, thus eliminating the delay inherent
in the preliminary measured course and permit
trains to follow one another more closely for a given block 
length.

### Automatic Train Operation

Basically cab signaling provides carborne
automatic train protection in the form of collision
prevention. With the addition of on-board equipmerit
for sensing and comparing command (allowable)
and actual speed, cab signaling makes it possible
to expand the train protection function to permit
speed regulation. This, in turn, forms the basis for
extending automation into the area of train operation.

Several forms of automatic train operation
(ATO) are possible, but all have two basic
features-automatic speed regulation and station
stopping.

Automatic speed regulation (ASR), as the name
implies, is basically a comparator circuit for matching
actual speed to command speed. Speed comands
received from coded track circuits are picked up by
a carborne receiver, decoded, and compared to actual
train speed sensed by a tachometer in the drive
mechanism. Up to this point, an automatic speed
regulation system is like cab signaling. The
difference arises in how this comparison is used.
With cab signals, the comparison is used to actuate
a penalty brake application to stop the train when
actual speed exceeds command speed. With ASR,
the comparison is used to control the motors and
brakes in an effort to minimize the difference between
actual and command speed. An advisory display
of speed commands and train speed may be
provided for the operator. In effect, ASR removes
the human operator from the control loop for running
the train and provides for an essentially instantaneous
and invariant response by propulsion and
braking systems, without the delay of human reaction
time and without the variability and possibility
for misinterpretation inherent in manual train
operation.

The other basic element of ATO is station stopping,
which involves bringing the train to stop
automatically at a predetermined location in each
station. This is accomplished by special wayside
control units working in cooperation with position
receivers, logic circuits, and automatic speed
regulation equipment on the train. One method
uses wayside “triggers” spaced some distance from
the station as reference points for programed stopping.
The first trigger, farthest from the station.
transmits a command signal that
board the train, a velocity-distance
generates, on
profile which
the train is to follow to a stop. Additional triggers,
nearer the station platform, correct the generated
velocity-distance profile for the effects of wheel
slip and slide. The ASR system monitors the
velocity-distance profile and controls the braking
effort to bring the train to a stop at a predetermined
point. Another method of programed stopping
makes use of long wayside antenna to provide a
series of position signals to a carborne control
system as the train passes along its length. The carborne
control system determines train position and
combines this with speed and deceleration information
(sensed on board the train), to produce an appropriate
propulsion or braking command for the
traction control system.

To this basic ATO system, other automated
features may be added. Doors can be opened
automatically after the train is brought to a stop in a
station, This requires a circuit to actuate door opening
mechanisms and appropriate safety interlocks to
assure that the train is in fact stopped and at a station.
Door closure may also be automated by adding
a timing circuit to measure how long the doors have
been open and to initiate a door closure signal
automatically after a predetermined dwell time has
elapsed. Train departure can also be initiated
automatically by introducing another control circuit
to apply propulsion power after receipt of a signal
confirming that doors are closed and locked.

For each of these levels of ATO, the train operator
may be provided with an advisory display to
show what commands are being received and what
response is being made by automatic mechanisms.
The operator may also be provided with manual
override controls to inhibit automatic functions or
to vary automatic system operation. For example,
the operator may intervene manually to adjust the
stopping point, to prevent some or all doors from
opening, to vary station dwell time, or to initiate or
prevent departure. Figure 8 shows a functional
diagram of a typical ATO system and a picture of
the train operator’s console.

### interlocking

An interlocking is an arrangement of signals and
signal appliances so interconnected that functions
must succeed each other in a predetermined sequence,
thus permitting safe train movements along
a selected route without collision or derailment. An
interlocking thus consists of more than just
switches to allow trains to move along crossing,
merging or branching routes; it is also made up of
signals and control devices that automatically prevent
conflicting or improper movements. Interlocking
may be manually controlled or equipped with
automatic devices that sort trains through branches
and junctions according to desired destinations.

Several forms of automatic interlocking are in
use. One of the oldest and simplest is an arrangement
of hand-operated switches, each of which
controls an individual signal or track turnout. The
switches are mechanically or electrically interconnected
such that once a particular route is selected,
the switch points locked in place, and the signals
cleared, no other route for a potentially conflicting
move can be established until the train bound for
the cleared route has safely passed, This arrangement
represents a semiautomated form of movement
control, Manual operation is required to select
a route and move the control levers, but all else
follows automatically, including inhibition of
further switch movement until the train has traversed
the limits of the interlocking.

A more advanced, but still not completely automated,
type of interlocking is a system that permits
a towerman or central supervisor to select the
entrance and exit points for a train to pass through
an interlocking, with the switches and signals for
t h e a p p r o p r i a t e r o u t e t h e n b e i n g s e t u p
automatically by an arrangement of electrical
relays, Figure 10 shows such a control panel for a
system called entrance-exit route interlocking, The
tower operator moves the control knobs to designate
a desired route. Internal logic circuits
automatically select the best available nonconflicting
route, aline and lock switches, and activate the
appropriate wayside signals to allowing train movement
while holding other signals at stop to prevent
conflicting moves. This level of automation may be
characterized as automatic execution in response to
manual inputs.

Fully automatic interlocking are also in use. In
addition to track circuits, switch operation, and signal
control elements, the automatic interlocking
must have some device for identifying a specific
train in order to create the necessary input to the
logic circuits.22 One method to identify trains is by
means of wayside optical device that scans a panel
on the lead car which gives destination, route, and
other needed information. Another method makes
use of a carborne transponder that is interrogated by
a wayside device. With either technique, however,
train identity becomes the substitute for manual inputs
that allows trains to be sent along predetermined
routes without human involvement.

### Train Supervision Equipment

Train supervision embraces a wide variety of
functions. The special-purpose equipment that has
been developed to perform these functions is
equally varied. In a general survey of train control
technology it is not possible to describe all types of
automatic and semiautomatic devices that are in
use. The following, therefore, is a brief catalog of
some of the more important systems.

Train dispatching is concerned with the timing of
train departures from terminals in accordance with
the schedule of operations. In conventional transit
systems this function is accomplished by
preprogrammed dispatching machines that
automatically ring a bell or flash a light as a signal
to the train operator that it is time to leave a terminal
or intermediate waypoint. In some systems,
the dispatch function may be assigned to a central
train control computer that transmits electric starting
signals to the train in accordance with a master
schedule stored in the computer memory.

Route assignment and control is a train supervisory
function that is allied to the train protection
function of route interlocking. Route control is a
strategic function, consisting of selecting routes for
trains and transmitting the orders to wayside points,
where the orders are implemented tactically by interlocking
equipment. In conventional transit
systems, route assignment and control is performed
locally, either manually or automatically, With
remotely controlled route interlocking, however, it
becomes operationally practical to place the
strategic and tactical management of routing in a
computer. The programing to accomplish this is
relatively simple and straightforward, and a computer
is ideally suited to handle what is an essentially
repetitious task with a limited number of
alternative courses of action. The safety aspects of
route interlocking are assured not by central computer
control, but locally by conventional interlocking
equipment at the wayside.

Performance monitoring involves comparing the
overall movement of traffic with the schedule and
taking action to smooth out irregularities of traffic
flow. In most transit systems this function is carried
out by central control personnel aided by automatic
display devices. One such device is a pen recorder
that marks a moving paper graph to record the
passage of trains past check points, Each spike on
the graph indicates the presence of a train, as
detected by the track circuits, at some time and
place along the route. A train supervisor, by checking
this graph against the schedule, can monitor the
progress of all trains operating on line and detect
delays or queuing up of trains.

Another form of performance monitoring aid is
the model board (figure 11), which is a schematic
representation of the track plan of the transit
system with indicator lights to denote track circuit
occupancy and, hence, the position of each train on
the line, This is the functional equivalent of the
pengraph recorder, but in a more pictorial form of
display. Another type of model board used in newer
transit systems has, in addition to the master track
plan, small cathode ray tube displays that permit individual
supervisors to obtain more detailed or expanded
views of selected track sections or to call up
special-purpose presentations of data.

Pengraphs, model boards, and the like are not
fully automatic supervisory devices. The human
operator is still needed to interpret the display and
to formulate orders to individual trains. In the most
advanced systems routine performance monitoring
is assigned to computers, which keep a continuous
watch on traffic movement and automatically
calculate and transmit performance commands to
trains. Man, in this circumstance, acts in a completely
different supervisory capacity. He does not
monitor and regulate traffic. Instead, he supervises
machines which, in turn, monitor and regulate
traffic.

There are two general types of action that can be
taken to smooth out irregularities in traffic flow.
Both are accomplished in response to commands
from central control. One is to hold a train in a station
for a time longer or shorter than the scheduled
dwell time or, in extreme cases, to direct a train to
bypass a station in order to close up a gap. The other
method is to alter the speed of the train between
stations. This latter method is called performance
level modification and takes the form of a proportional
reduction of train speed below the speed normally
allowed in each block. In systems supervised
by a central computer and with automatic train
operation, performance level modification is accomplished
without human intervention. The required
reduction is calculated by the central computer
and automatically transmitted to stations or
other critical locations, where the signals are picked
up by carborne ATO equipment that modifies the
response to the normal speed commands transmitted
by the coded track circuits. These systems may
also include provisions for manual inputs and displays
at central control or on the train, but the normal
mode of operation is automatic.
